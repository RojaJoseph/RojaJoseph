I’m an AI/ML Associate with 2.5+ years of experience building production-ready AI solutions that deliver real business impact. My work focuses on computer vision, digital twins, RAG-based chatbots, and data-driven dashboards.

At Easy Link Web & IT Solutions, I’ve led the development of AI-driven MVPs, improving operational efficiency by 30%, and built AI-powered customer support chatbots with WhatsApp integration that reduced response times by 40%. I’ve also worked on Digital Twin–based predictive maintenance systems, minimizing downtime by 25%.

My technical strengths include developing high-precision object detection and segmentation models (YOLOv8), building automated video processing pipelines using Python and OpenCV, and deploying scalable backend services with FastAPI and REST APIs. I’ve handled end-to-end workflows—from data annotation and model training to deployment and visualization.

I’ve also developed executive dashboards using BigQuery, Looker Studio, Power BI, and Streamlit, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. Additionally, I’ve built RAG-based enterprise chatbots using LangChain, FAISS, and Transformers to improve knowledge accessibility.

I enjoy solving real-world problems using AI and collaborating with cross-functional teams to build scalable, impactful solutions.
